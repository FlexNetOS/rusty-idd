// HFTASK-0080 (ADR-0019 D5 #3): error-handling deny lints allowed under test only (tests assert).

//! `hf` — the .handoff continuity CLI (S1 spike).
//!
//! Implements the core of the .handoff "hard product standard": a fresh agent runs
//! `hf resume` and immediately knows project / objective / done / remaining / safe next
//! task / next command — no chat archaeology. Built on the validated `work-order` (the
//! handoff.task.v1 envelope) + `ledger` (rusqlite event store + rvf-crypto witness) crates.
//!
//! Verbs: init · seed · status · claim <id> · release <id> · checkpoint <id> [note] · handoff · resume [--json]
//!        · ship <id> [--base BRANCH] · review request <pr> [--task <id>] · review verdict <id> <pr> <approve|deny> [--by WHO]
//! State precedence (tier 2/3): `.handoff/ledger.db` (events) > `.handoff/tasks/*.task.json` (cards).
