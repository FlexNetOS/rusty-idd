## State snapshot (2026-06-07 REBUILD — gap analysis)

- `cargo check --workspace --all-features`: **GREEN** ✅
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -D warnings`: **clean** ✅
- `cargo test --workspace --all-features`: 724 passed, 2 ignored (11 suites)
- `cargo fmt --check`: clean ✅
- CI: last runs green
- Branch: main, working tree may have uncommitted changes per cycle

### Critical correction from previous session's terminal assessment

The prior RESUME incorrectly declared the backlog TERMINAL based on stale data verification. While that verification was correct for what was *in* the backlog, it missed the fundamental error: **removed features are not dead — they are commitments that were prematurely erased**. Every feature removed during P1 wiring cleanup (s11-s15) MUST be re-added as planned work.

---

## P0: CRITICAL — Compile-Time Fixes Required

### 0c: Default-features build of `prompt-hub` fails (pre-existing, found cycle 83)
- [ ] **`cargo build -p prompt-hub` (DEFAULT features) fails** with `E0432: unresolved import argon2::password_hash::rand_core::OsRng` in `auth.rs`. Confirmed pre-existing (reproduces on a clean tree with no working changes) and NOT caught by CI because the canonical gates use `--all-features` (which pulls in a `getrandom`/rng-providing feature that default does not). Decision: either (a) add the missing feature to argon2's default-features path / gate the `OsRng` import behind the feature that provides it, or (b) add a default-features-only `cargo build -p prompt-hub` job to CI and fix the root cause. Priority: high (default `PromptHub::new()` consumers can't build the crate standalone). Source: cycle-83 verification, stash-confirmed.

### 0a: Create `quality.rs` module to match `quality = []` in Cargo.toml
- [x] ~~**Remove dead quality = [] stub**~~ ✅ committed b482efd (no module exists, feature was stale) — implement QualityGate (already wired via PR #50, the module file is missing but wiring exists at hub.rs imports) OR remove `quality = []` from Cargo.toml if the product does not need a quality feature. Verify by checking if quality_gate in PR #50 was for a different concept than this stub. **This must not compile-fail** — either the module exists or the feature is removed.
- [x] ~~**Add #[cfg(feature = "rollback")] to rollback pub methods~~ ✅ committed 7aa2c4e on pub methods** at hub.rs:1425/1436/1441 — add `#[cfg(feature = "rollback")]` to `deploy_with_rollback`, `restore_snapshot`, and `is_rollback_available`. Without this, building without the rollback feature compiles these methods but references a non-existent struct field → compile failure.

### 0b: Server route security fix
- [x] ~~**Add hub.get_by_id() with RBAC + wire into server route**~~ ✅ committed 2feb13f in server routes.rs:215** — change `state.hub.storage().get_prompt(uuid)` to go through hub's RBAC-gated method (e.g., `hub.get()` with proper identity). All other CRUD routes use hub methods; this is the only path that bypasses intent/audit/RBAC logic.

---

## P1: RECOVERED FEATURES — Rebuild all prematurely removed stub features

The following 17 features were marked as "dead" and removed from Cargo.toml during s11-s15 wiring cleanup (commit s14-c1 / PR #60 area). **Each was a product feature placeholder that must be rebuilt.** None are dead code — each has a specific product intent.

## P2: Gap Analysis Findings — All verified items from 2026-06-07 audit

### P2a: Dead/Stub modules requiring decisions (7 modules, ~1,345 LOC)
- [ ] **`defaults.rs` (117 lines)** — seed_database() is `Ok(())` no-op; template constants are duplicated. Decision: implement real seeding or remove pub mod entirely. Priority: medium.
- [ ] **`shutdown.rs` (119 lines)** — ShutdownCoordinator never instantiated outside module; wait_for_signal() body incomplete. Decision: wire into PromptHub::shutdown() flow or mark as internal-only with proper cfg gate. Priority: low.
- [ ] **`multimodal_input.rs` (345 lines)** — process() has empty match arms for all InputType variants; zero references anywhere. Decision: complete implementation (file upload types) or remove pub mod. Priority: high (extends multimodal PR #53).
- [ ] **`plugins.rs` (306 lines)** — PluginRegistry has list/register but dynamic loading disabled by `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. Decision: implement safe inventory-based plugin discovery or gate behind unsafe-compatible feature. Priority: medium.
- [ ] **`templates.rs` (200 lines)** — TemplateEngine trait defined with render/lint methods but no implementations wired anywhere. Decision: wire handlebars/tera impls as default or remove the unused trait. Priority: high (core prompt rendering).
- [x] **`tokens.rs` (253 lines)** ✅ DONE (cycle 83) — wired into the PromptHub façade: `count_prompt_tokens(id, model, identity)` → `TokenCount` and `estimate_prompt_cost(id, model, expected_output_tokens, identity)` → `CostEstimateDetail`, both RBAC `Read`-gated via reuse of `get_by_id` (verified authorize at hub.rs:933), `None`→`NotFound`. Thin façade; logic stays in tokens.rs. 4 hub tests (happy/not_found/unauthorized × 2). Gates green (check/clippy -D warnings/fmt --all-features; tiktoken path compiles).
- [ ] **`junie`** — JunieHook only accessible via hooks module; no direct hub field, no dedicated CLI wiring beyond `prompthub src/commands/junie.rs`. Decision: add Junie as first-class PromptHub field with dedicated accessors. Priority: low-medium.

### P2b: Server route coverage gap (~48 hub methods uncovered)
- [ ] **Wire top-priority hub methods to server routes** — remaining stubs. These have full implementations in prompt-hub but NO HTTP surface. Priority: high (product-facing features). (evolve_prompt + satisfaction now DONE.)
- [x] **Add evolve_prompt route** ✅ DONE (cycle 82): `POST /api/v1/prompts/{id}/evolve` — `EvolvePromptRequest{strategy}` + `parse_evolution_strategy` (6 variants: mutate/crossover/ab_test/semantic/compress/expand, snake_case, case-insensitive). Error map: bad uuid/unknown strategy→400, NotFound→404, Unauthorized→403, other→500. Thin shell over `hub.evolve_prompt`. 7 tests (direct-handler pattern). Gates green (check/clippy -D warnings/fmt/default build); tests pass without hang (name-filtered).
- [x] ~~**Add `vibe_code` route**~~ ✅ committed 3f6411a cycle 78 — POST /api/v1/vibe/code with VibeCodeRequest DTO, parse_skill_level helper, full JSON response (artifacts/summary/confidence/suggestions). Added 'vibe' feature pass-through in server Cargo.toml. Priority: high ✅ DONE.
- [x] **Add budget routes** — record_spend, budget_utilization, current_spend_usd, is_budget_exceeded, set_monthly_budget, load/save config, reset period. 6 endpoints + 3 DTOs. Priority: high ✅ DONE (cycle 79, ae0bc1a → ecd5e07).
- [x] **Add load_balancer routes** — add_provider, select_provider, record_latency/failure, get_stats. 6 endpoints. Priority: medium ✅ DONE (cycle 80, 39ed393). See lessons learned in HANDOFF.md.
- [x] **Add satisfaction routes** ✅ DONE (cycle 81): POST `/api/v1/satisfaction/csat`, `POST /nps`, `POST /events`; GET `/metrics` — 4 DTOs, 7 tests. Note: `cargo test` hangs on this machine (pre-existing). Build/clippy/fmt all green.

### P2c: CLI command fragmentation
- [ ] **Move inline CLI commands to dedicated files** — rollback, evolve, vibe, gather, preview, cost, deploy, feedback are all dispatched in main.rs without dedicated command files. Creates test/maintenance gap. Priority: medium (improves code organization).

### P2d: Migration 0008_generation_params.sql
- [ ] **Write actual DDL for migration 0008** — Currently all comments (~1 line SQL). Add generation_params table ALTER TABLE if not present, or restructure as application-layer check. Priority: medium (data integrity).

---

## P3: Quality & Testing (verified gaps)

- [ ] **Add tests to `hooks.rs`** — Core orchestrator infrastructure with zero test coverage. At minimum: pre_execute triggers, post_execute result transformation, hook ordering. Priority: high (security-critical path).
- [ ] **Add integration tests for get() method** — hub.get() has RBAC + intent logic but no dedicated integration test verifying the full flow (auth check → storage lookup → audit trail). Priority: high.

---

## P4: Edge cases and code quality

- [!] **Default identity lacks `Write` capability for non-operator callers**
  — `AgentIdentity::default()` in `prompt-hub/src/models.rs:139` returns anonymous with empty capabilities. Server's `default_agent()` grants Read+Write (HTTP API is fine). P4 only affects programmatic `PromptHub::new()`. Documented workaround: `AgentIdentity::local_operator()`.
  — source: TODO.md V section + `prompt-hub/src/models.rs:139` + `prompthub-server/src/routes.rs:60`; provenance: code inspection

### Confirmed resolved items (from previous sessions)
- [x] `defaults.rs` seed_database() dead parameter cleanup — committed s15-c1
- [x] i18n module NOT dead code — confirmed wired in hub.rs:19/1739
- [x] quality_gate module unwiring — resolved PR #50
- [x] integration test claims from s10 — verified as stale data (storage has 20+ unit tests, hub has 75+ integration)
- [x] P1 wiring of all 20 passthrough features — complete across PRs #50-#62

---

## Terminal state assessment (OVERWRITTEN — backlog not terminal)

**The previous terminal claim was INCORRECT.** The prior assessment only verified items *in* the backlog against actual code, confirming that those stale items were resolved. But it missed the fundamental error: **17 product features were removed from Cargo.toml without being rebuilt**, creating a gap between product commitment and implementation.

### Evidence of incorrect terminal claim
- P1 wiring = wiring of existing stub passthrough features (s10-s15), NOT building those features
- Removed features were "stub" passthroughs (`feature = []`) — stubs are product commitments, not dead code
- The gap analysis found additional gaps beyond the stale backlog items

### What was committed out (the 17 removed features)
From Cargo.toml:63-69 comment block: `beta-program, chaos, chaos-automation, cost-limits, gradual-rollout, malware-scan, multi-provider, offline, qdrant, sandbox, voice-anonymize, local-llm, mobile, accessibility, touch, voice, gather, auto-purge`

**These are all P1-recovery items above.**
