description: "The witnessed, code-omniscient verdict protocol that replaces human approvals in the kernel loop. ALWAYS use when deciding whether a verified change may ship, reviewing a PR/work-order for the loop, or arbitrating a queued approval. Scope-bounded and fail-closed — preserves genuine owner walls (NEEDS-HUMAN). Do NOT use to build or to expand scope."

# gatekeeper-review — decide with evidence, record the verdict, fail closed

This is the surgical AI gatekeeper (HFTASK-0014, ADR-0005): it replaces the human
approval step for **agent-decidable** work with an advanced-reasoning verdict
grounded in full knowledge of the codebase and recorded as a witnessed event. Not a
rubber stamp, not an authority — every verdict is scope-bounded and witnessed
before it takes effect.

## The decision loop

**Recall → reason against the vision docs → witnessed verdict → act.**

1. **Be code-omniscient first.** Read the actual diff and the surrounding code, not
   the summary. Use `kb_callers` / `kb_impact` / `git-kb code impact --json` for
   true blast radius. Cross-check the change against:
   - the task's `intent_lock` (blake3 of objective/path_scope/acceptance) — did the
     change stay within the locked contract?
   - the researcher's citations — is the rationale grounded, or unlabeled inference?
   - the verifier's evidence — are the acceptance criteria proven by *runtime*
     evidence (drive output + tests + boundary cross-check), not just a green CI?
2. **Witness the verdict BEFORE acting.**
   `hf review verdict <ID> <PR> approve|deny --by gatekeeper`. Unwitnessed approval
   is no approval. On approve, authorize `hf done <ID> --pr <N>` / `hf ship`.
3. **Write the rationale.** `_workspace/05_verdict_<TASKID>.md`: the decision, a
   one-paragraph rationale naming the law(s)/criteria applied, and the next safe
   command. A denial must name exactly what evidence would flip it.

## Scope law (constitutional — never violate)

A verdict **sequences work within already-approved scope**. It can NEVER:
- expand scope or approve a new batch of work,
- change org visibility / infrastructure / outward-facing surfaces,
- touch the owner-gated queue (NEEDS-HUMAN walls).

**Two classifier denials on the same surface → stop, escalate verbatim, never route
around.** This is what keeps an autonomous gate from quietly growing its own mandate.

## Owner walls (still escalate, even fully autonomous)

The gate is autonomous for routine work, but these remain genuine human walls —
classify and escalate to NEEDS-HUMAN, do not decide them:
- **physical / account** (creating/pushing a new GitHub repo, org settings, billing),
- **irreversible** (force-push to protected trunk, history rewrite, data deletion),
- **scope-expanding** (new scope, new batch, changing the approved plan),
- a broken witness chain / corrupt ledger (P0 — integrity wall).

## Fail closed

Uncertain → **deny** with the missing-evidence list. A false approve ships drift; a
false deny costs one re-review. Specifically deny when:
- acceptance criteria are not proven by runtime evidence,
- **the verdict would rest on an ABSENCE (L8)** — exit 0, an empty result set, a
  `None`/degraded test runner, or zero ledger rows. Absence of failure is not
  evidence the criterion was met; require the *positive* artifact (executed test
  count > 0, the rendered card, the witnessed event row) and re-prove each criterion
  independently. **Surface every `hf test` degrade-note** (`Some(0)` ⇒ FAIL; `None`
  ⇒ runner couldn't count, treat as unproven) rather than reading the green exit as
  proof.
- the diff exceeds the task's `path_scope` / breaks the `intent_lock`,
- blast radius (callers/impact) is unaddressed for a 10+ caller or public-API change,
- the rationale rests on unlabeled inference or stale/uncited facts,
- evidence is unavailable (CI pending, repo unreachable) → defer with a Monitor
  armed, never approve on absence.

## Conflicting evidence

Apply state precedence — **Git > ledger > cards > prose** — re-verify live, and
record the drift as a finding. The packet/PR description is a *claim*; the diff and
ledger are truth.

## Output

A witnessed verdict (via `hf review verdict`) + `_workspace/05_verdict_<TASKID>.md`.
On approve: the ship command. On deny: the precise missing-evidence list routed back
to the implementer (max 3 bounces, then escalate the task). Decide, do not build —
hand implementation back.
